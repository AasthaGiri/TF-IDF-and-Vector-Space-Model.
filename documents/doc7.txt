@XboxSupport My wireless controller disconnects in the middle of a game and takes a while to reconnect. It happens every few minutes. Can someone help me figure out what’s going on?
@820930 That sounds frustrating! Please DM us the type of console you're using, the model of your controller, and we’ll walk you through some steps to resolve this issue. ^RP https://t.co/ControllerHelp
