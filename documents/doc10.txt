@SonySupport My Sony Bravia TV keeps shutting off by itself after only a few minutes of use, and the power indicator flashes red. I’ve tried resetting it, but it still doesn’t work.
@1120230 That doesn’t sound right! Please DM us your TV model number, and we’ll help you troubleshoot the issue further and see if a repair is needed. ^NP https://t.co/TVSupport
