@SamsungSupport My Galaxy S10 keeps restarting itself randomly throughout the day, even when I’m not doing anything intensive. I already tried a factory reset, but it didn’t help.
@720830 That definitely doesn’t sound normal! Please DM us your phone’s model number, software version, and any other recent changes made to your device, and we’ll assist you with troubleshooting. ^CK https://t.co/DeviceHelp
